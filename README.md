# polys_Improved_FIA
An Arma Reforger mod that improves the FIA with some new equipment.


The main changes are;

Arsenal overhauled with new equipment selection & some civilian clothing.
Sa vz. 58 replaced with M14 (M21 SWS) or AK-74, depending on the role.
UK vz. 59 replaced with PKM.
ALICE or Lifchik webbing added to all units, depending on their weapon.
Squad Leaders equipped with GP-25 grenade launchers, due to the lack of a proper grenadier role.
Removal of radios for some units.
Removal of flak jackets for all units.

This is a replacement patch, so it's compatible with gamemodes like Conflict out of the box. Just don't run this with another FIA replacement patch.
